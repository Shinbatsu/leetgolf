> "No time to explain! Code as short as possible!" â€” *Jason Statham* ðŸ˜ˆ

Donâ€™t you sometimes feel that solving LeetCode problems isâ€¦ a little dull?

Endless loops of algorithms, data structures, and complexity â€” all so repetitiveâ€¦

## How to make it exciting?!

I believe coding can be more delightful, even thrilling! Thatâ€™s why I created this little corner of fun.
Iâ€™d be truly thrilled if someone joined me in this playful challenge.

The Challenge

1. No explanations â€” just code as short as possible!
2. Forget time and memory complexity â€” let creativity flow.
3. The solution must pass all the tests â€” a little proof of magic.
